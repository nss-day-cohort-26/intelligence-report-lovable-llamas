        <h2>BREAKING NEWS REPORT</h2>
        <img class="malone" src="../mug-shot.jpg" alt="mugshot">
        <p> We come to you tonight with a breaking news story on Scott Malone. Scott was first arrested in Thailand 
    in 1987 by the Royal Thai Police Dept. Crimes consisted of a maple syrup theft, breaking and entering, and assualt on a police officer.
    Once released from Bang Kwang Prison in Thailand, he went under the radar for a while. Then popping back 
    up in Washington State, Scott was arrested for grand theft auto by a Seattle Police officer, James King. After serving a little over a year, 
    he was released for so called good behavior. Violating his parole, he skipped town and fled to Mexico.
    There he was arrested for the murder of a state official named Jose Gonzalez. A few witnesses came forward claiming
    to have seen the entire thing, but all died mysteriously before his court date. Sentenced for murder he went to Topo Chico Penitentiary, 
    but escaped with the help of a paid guard, and then fled the country. Obtaining a illegal flight he is now underground again, and in an unknown 
    location. Reports of Scott Malone have been few and far between. Files also show that Scott could very well be involved in the CSIS (Canadian
    Security Intelligence Service). With that being said, there is little to no proof of this statement.. We asked our viewers to complete a survey on the likelihood of finding Scott, with a scale of 1-10, the majority surprisingly resided on the lower end of the scale. A reward of
    $50,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest of this individual. Check back for more
    as the story unfolds.
