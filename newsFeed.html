    <h3>BREAKING</h3>
    <p>We come to you tonight with a breaking news story on Scott Malone. Scott was first arrested in Thailand 
        in 1987. Crimes consisted of a maple syrup theft, breaking and entering, and assualt on a police officer.
    Once released from Bang Kwang Prison, he went under the radar for a while. Scott then popped back 
    up in Washington State, where he was arrested for grand theft auto. After serving a little over a year, 
    he was released. Violating his parole, he skipped town and went to Mexico. There he was arrested for 
    the murder of a state official. Although he was not incarcerated for long because he escaped Topo Chico,
    and fled the country.
